      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Asteria</strong> -- a creative, intuitive, deeply analytical
        soul who lives at the intersection of design, technology, healing, and
        self-discovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a developer-in-training, digital graphic designer, and shadow work
        mentor with a love for turning complex ideas into visually beautiful,
        emotionally resonant experiences. Whether I'm designing in Canva,
        building guides, organizing aesthetic notes in Craft, or learning to
        code, my work is rooted in one core value: making things feel clearer,
        softer, and more empowering for the people who encounter them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creativity has always been my language. I express it through design,
        writing, systems, and symbolic work like tarot and spiritual
        exploration. I'm especially drawn to creating guides, frameworks, and
        resources that help people understand themselves better -- not in a
        surface-level, "good vibes only" way, but in a real, honest, sometimes
        messy way that leads to genuine growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also a magickal practitioner, though my relationship with my
        practice has evolved over time. After stepping away for a few years,
        I'm currently in a phase of gentle reconnection -- rediscovering what
        spirituality looks like when it's rooted in joy, curiosity, and daily
        devotion rather than pressure or perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living with multiple chronic physical and mental health conditions has
        shaped how I move through the world. It's taught me patience,
        adaptability, and a deep respect for energy -- mine and others’.
        Because of this, I approach everything I do with intention and
        compassion.
      </p>

      <p>
        I describe myself as confrontational but thoughtful -- I ask hard
        questions, challenge assumptions, and enjoy digging beneath the
        surface. I'm analytical, curious, and often scattered, but that
        scatteredness is where some of my best ideas come from.
      </p>

      <p>
        At home, I share life with my fiancé, Jordan, along with our dog Chip.
        I'm more drawn to quiet, intentional activities -- reading, coloring,
        designing, organizing thoughts, and planning a life that feels aligned
        rather than overwhelming.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        At my core, I believe that
        <em>clarity is healing, creativity is sacred, and self-understanding is a lifelong practice</em>.
        If you value depth, honesty, aesthetics, and growth that actually
        sticks -- you’ll probably feel right at home here.
      </p>
