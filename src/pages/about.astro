      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Asteria</strong> — a creative, intuitive, deeply analytical
          soul who lives at the intersection of design, technology, healing, and self-discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a developer-in-training, digital graphic designer, and shadow work
          mentor with a love for turning complex ideas into visually beautiful,
          emotionally resonant experiences. Whether I'm designing in Canva,
          building guides, organizing aesthetic notes in Craft, or learning to
          code, my work is rooted in one core value: making things feel clearer,
          softer, and more empowering for the people who encounter them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Creativity has always been my language. I express it through design,
          writing, systems, and symbolic work like tarot and spiritual
          exploration. I'm especially drawn to creating guides, frameworks, and
          resources that help people understand themselves better — not in a
          surface-level, "good vibes only" way, but in a real, honest, sometimes
          messy way that leads to genuine growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also a magickal practitioner, though my relationship with my
          practice has evolved over time. After stepping away for a few years,
          I'm currently in a phase of gentle reconnection — rediscovering what
          spirituality looks like when it's rooted in joy, curiosity, and daily
          devotion rather than pressure or perfection. I believe magic doesn't
          have to be grand or dramatic; sometimes it's simply showing up, paying
          attention, and choosing yourself again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Living with multiple chronic physical and mental health conditions has
          shaped how I move through the world. It's taught me patience,
          adaptability, and a deep respect for energy — mine and others'.
          Because of this, I approach everything I do with intention and
          compassion. I'm not interested in hustle culture or rigid
          productivity; I care about sustainable creativity, realistic routines,
          and systems that support real humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          I describe myself as confrontational but thoughtful — I ask hard
          questions, challenge assumptions (including my own), and enjoy digging
          beneath the surface. I'm analytical, curious, and often scattered, but
          that scatteredness is where some of my best ideas come from. I love
          learning, especially when it comes to coding, psychology, symbolism,
          and self-development, and I thrive when I can connect ideas across
          different disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          At home, I share life with my fiancé, Jordan, who has been my partner
          for over five years, along with our loving dog Chip. I'm more drawn to
          quiet, intentional activities than TV — reading, coloring, designing,
          organizing thoughts, or planning the kind of life that feels aligned
          rather than overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p>
          At my core, I'm someone who believes that <em
            >clarity is healing, creativity is sacred, and self-understanding is
            a lifelong practice</em
          >. I'm here to build, learn, soften, question, and create things that
          matter — for myself first, and eventually for others who resonate with
          the way I see the world.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
          If you're someone who values depth, honesty, aesthetics, and growth
          that actually sticks — you'll probably feel right at home here.
        </p>
