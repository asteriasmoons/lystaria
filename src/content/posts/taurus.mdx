*The Taurus season typically begins on April 20th and ends on May 20th.*

<GradientDivider />

Taurus season carries a slow, steady energy that encourages grounding, presence, and appreciation for what already exists. It’s a time to reconnect with your body, your senses, and the rhythms that help you feel secure and supported. Rather than rushing forward, this season invites patience, comfort, and building stability in ways that feel nourishing and sustainable.

## Positive Traits
Taurus energy is deeply rooted in reliability and perseverance. There is a natural steadiness here that allows progress to happen gradually and with intention. Taurus tends to approach challenges with patience, staying calm and grounded even when situations feel demanding.

Trustworthiness is another defining strength. Taurus energy values consistency and follow-through, showing care through dependability rather than urgency. This makes Taurus a stabilizing presence, someone others can rely on when things feel uncertain.

Practicality also plays a strong role. Taurus often prefers realistic solutions and tangible results, taking a grounded approach to decision-making. Alongside this practicality is a deep appreciation for comfort, beauty, and the physical world, bringing a sensory richness to everyday life.

## Negative Traits
Because Taurus values stability, change can sometimes feel threatening. There may be a tendency toward stubbornness or resistance when routines are disrupted, even if the change could ultimately be beneficial.

Attachment is another potential challenge. Wanting security and comfort can occasionally turn into holding on too tightly -- to habits, people, or situations -- long after they’ve stopped serving growth. Letting go may feel uncomfortable when familiarity provides a sense of safety.

Taurus energy can also become overly focused on material comfort. While enjoying physical pleasures is a strength, imbalance may arise when comfort becomes avoidance or when flexibility is sacrificed for predictability. Learning when to soften and adapt can help restore balance.

## Magical Workings
Taurus magic centers on grounding, stability, and connection to the physical world. This is a supportive time for magic focused on embodiment, comfort, and creating a sense of safety -- both internally and externally. Taurus energy favors slow, intentional practices over anything rushed or elaborate.

Sensory-based magic feels especially aligned during this season. Working with scent, touch, taste, or sound can help anchor intentions in the present moment. Simple practices like lighting a candle, enjoying a mindful ritual, or spending time with natural elements can be deeply effective.

Taurus magic also supports manifestation through consistency rather than force. Repeating gentle intentions, working steadily with affirmations, or focusing on what already feels abundant can help build a strong energetic foundation over time.
